Mediawiki to GFM is a script to convert a set of [Mediawiki](https://www.mediawiki.org)
pages to [GitHub Flavoured Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) (GFM). This script was written from a necessity to convert a MediaWiki installation to a GitLab wiki. This code is based on [MediaWiki to Markdown](https://github.com/philipashlock/mediawiki-to-markdown) by [Philip Ashlock](https://github.com/philipashlock/). Philip graciously gave us permission to post our version as a new project.

Major differences include the addition of PHPUnit tests, code is broken into classes, deprecated code removed, and a fix for a common MediaWiki user error added.

## Requirements

* PHP: Requires PHP 8.4 or newer
* Pandoc: Installation instructions are here https://pandoc.org/installing.html
    * Requires Pandoc 3.9 or newer
* MediaWiki: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki
    * This script operates on a MediaWiki XML export file, not a running MediaWiki
      installation, so the MediaWiki version does not matter directly. What matters
      is the export format. It is built for the MediaWiki XML export schema
      (export-0.10), which has been stable across many MediaWiki releases.
* Composer: Installation instructions are here https://getcomposer.org/download/

## Installation 

    git clone https://github.com/outofcontrol/mediawiki-to-gfm.git
    cd mediawiki-to-gfm
    composer update --no-dev
    
## Run

Run the script on your exported MediaWiki XML file:

    ./convert.php --filename=/path/to/filename.xml --output=/path/to/converted/files 

## Options

    ./convert.php --filename=/path/to/filename.xml --output=/path/to/converted/files --format=gfm --addmeta --flatten --indexes

    --filename : Location of the mediawiki exported XML file to convert 
                 to GFM format (Required)
    --output   : Location where you would like to save the converted files
                 (Default: ./output)
    --format   : What format would you like to convert to. Default is GFM 
                 (for use in GitLab and GitHub) See pandoc documentation
                 for more formats (Default: 'gfm')
    --addmeta  : This flag will add a Permalink to each file (Default: false)
    --flatten  : This flag will force all pages to be saved in a single level 
                 directory. File names will be converted in the following way:
                 Mediawiki_folder/My_File_Name -> Mediawiki_folder_My_File_Name
                 and saved in a file called 'Mediawiki_folder_My_File_Name.md' 
                 (Default: false)
    --indexes  : Rename a file matching its directory name to index.md
                 (Default: false)
    --skiperrors : Do not stop on pandoc parsing errors, instead skip the file
                 (Default: false)
    --version  : Display the program version
    --help     : This help message

## Run with docker

Create a new directory and put `filename.xml` into the new directory:
```bash
mkdir my_wiki
mv filename.xml my_wiki/
cd my_wiki
```
Now you can convert `filename.xml` using docker.
Note: do **not** use the output parameter. The output will always be written into the subdirectory `output` of the current path. (hence the creation of a new directory). This is necessary, because the docker container does not have access to your filesystem except for the current directory (because of the `-v $PWD:/app` parameter for docker)
```bash
docker run -v $PWD:/app oooc/mediawiki-to-gfm --filename=filename.xml
```

## Build your own docker image

The published image is convenient, but you can build it yourself from a clone of
this repository. The Dockerfile lives in `docker/` but must be built from the
repository root so it can copy the application source. The helper scripts handle
this for you.

### Local build (for testing)

Builds an image for your machine architecture and loads it into your local
Docker daemon as `mediawiki-to-gfm`:
```bash
./docker/build.sh
```
Then run it exactly as shown in the "Run with docker" section above.

### Multi-architecture build and publish

`release.sh` builds for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` and pushes the
result to a registry in a single step (a multi-architecture image cannot be
loaded into the local daemon, only pushed). It requires Docker Buildx and a
logged-in registry session:
```bash
docker login
./docker/release.sh
```
This pushes `oooc/mediawiki-to-gfm:latest` and `:1.0.1`. Override the
defaults with environment variables:
```bash
VERSION=1.1.0 DOCKER_USERNAME=yourname ./docker/release.sh
```

## Export Mediawiki Files to XML 

In order to convert from MediaWiki format to GFM and use in GitLab (or GitHub), you will first need to export all the pages you wish to convert from Mediawiki into an XML file. Here are a few simple steps to help
you accomplish this quickly:

1. MediaWiki -> Special Pages -> 'All Pages'
1. With help from the filter tool at the top of 'All Pages', copy the page names to convert into a text file (one file name per line).
1. MediaWiki -> Special Pages -> 'Export'
1. Paste the list of pages into the Export field. 
1. Check: 'Include only the current revision, not the full history'  
   Note: This convert script will only do latest version, not revisions. 
1. Uncheck: Include Templates
1. Check: Save as file
1. Click on the 'Export' button.
1. An XML file will be saved locally. 
1. Use this convert.php script to convert the XML file a set of GFM formatted pages. 

In theory you can convert to any of these formats… (not tested):
